# VM_Test-Challenge
Mix of jquery and javascript. Mainly tried to stick to using vanilla javascript, a lot more lines of 'repetitive' code while
trying to follow DRY rules. 
First time utilizing drag and drop api for html5. Updates userid from the json placeholder api with a PATCH request when the user drags the album to another table.
